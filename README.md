# Netflix Content Segmentation

Which titles share interpretable catalog metadata? This project compares clustering approaches and connects internal diagnostics to representative titles and searchable group profiles. Intended for content exploration, not audience segmentation.

## Measured results

<!-- RESULTS:START -->
Evidence run: `20261106T115043590368Z`. Generated from the active artifact; not a business-impact claim.

**kmeans / k=10**, 8,783 entities. Mean silhouette **0.241**; same-catalog seed ARI **0.662**.

Selected among the recorded algorithm/count candidates using shared features and eligibility constraints. These are in-sample internal diagnostics, not held-out classification accuracy. PCA explains 25.9% of variance; no viewer personas or recommendation outcomes are verified.
<!-- RESULTS:END -->

## Decisions and implementation

Define similarity with explicit feature weights and compare candidates in the same representation. Group-size constraints and seed diagnostics complement silhouette; source genre taxonomy remains a major influence.

The implementation covers data audit and preparation, model comparison, saved evaluation artifacts, a FastAPI service, a React workspace, validation and Docker packaging. This describes repository capabilities; no business adoption or measured commercial impact is claimed.

## Reproduction boundary

**Artifact inference:** the included validated bundle supports the website without the raw CSV. **Training reproduction:** requires the original supplied CSV matching [the provenance record](data/provenance.json). The exact upstream source and redistribution permission remain unverified; no public substitute is asserted to reproduce this training input. The observed maximum date added is not a known acquisition date.

## Quickstart

Install Node 24, Python 3.11, Git and uv. In this repository's root:

```powershell
corepack enable
corepack pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
uv sync --frozen --all-packages
corepack pnpm dev
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:5173. API docs: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs. Stop both services with Ctrl+C. Run one repository at a time with these default ports.
The included validated bundle supports inference without the raw CSV. Training needs your own supplied `data/raw/Dataset.csv`, excluded from Git.

## Reproduce and verify

```powershell
uv run python scripts/train_segmentation.py
uv run python scripts/refresh_dataset.py
corepack pnpm types
uv run ruff check .
corepack pnpm test
corepack pnpm build
uv run pytest
corepack pnpm verify
```

Training creates a new immutable run; regenerate the dataset profile whenever activating another run. The API refuses a stale profile. No performance values are invented by the frontend. Run `uv run python scripts/refresh_readme.py` to update only the marked results above, or append `--check` to verify them. Source/provenance and run mismatches fail the command.

## Structure and documentation

- `apps/web`: project frontend; `/overview`, `/dataset`, project action, `/evaluation`, `/methodology`.
- `apps/api`: HTTP validation, artifact serving and `/api/v1/dataset`.
- `packages/ml`: shared utilities and project ML implementation; serialized class paths retained for artifact compatibility.
- `artifacts/task-04`: one selected run, checksums and active pointer.
- `reports/dataset-profile.json`: run-bound source, variables, decisions and intermediate outcomes.
- [Project verification](docs/VERIFICATION.md)
- [Docker / VPS deployment](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)
- [Architecture and deployment](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
